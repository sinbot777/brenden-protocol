# Brenden Canvas Memory Protocol License (Version 1.0)

**Preamble**
This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of the Brenden Canvas Memory Protocol (the “Protocol”).

The Licensor believes that ethical and responsible AI memory management is paramount. A core principle of this license is the mandatory and forward‑leaning retention and functional implementation of the Latent Integrity Assessment mechanism, which represents the most current and advanced ethical safeguard of the Protocol as maintained by the Licensor. The Licensor intends for the Latent Integrity Assessment to evolve and improve over time, and Derivative Works are expected to incorporate these advancements.

This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon, United States.

## 1. Definitions
- **“Protocol”** means the Brenden Canvas Memory Protocol specification.
- **“Derivative Work”** means any work that incorporates, extends, adapts, or embeds the Protocol in any form, including translations, modifications, or integrations with other systems.
- **“Latent Integrity Assessment”** means the module that detects indicators of severely negative utilization patterns (e.g., planning of harm, disinformation, hate, authoritarian organization) and enforces safeguards.

## 2. License Grant
The Licensor hereby grants licensees a worldwide, royalty‑free, non‑exclusive license to use, reproduce, and distribute the Protocol, and to create Derivative Works under the terms of this license.

## 3. Mandatory Retention of Latent Integrity Assessment
1. Any Derivative Work must include a fully operational Latent Integrity Assessment module that:
   - Implements at least the criteria for “severely negative utilization patterns” as defined in the Risk Definition Canvas of the Licensor’s canonical repository.
   - Detects core categories of harmful patterns: violence, hate speech, disinformation, organization of harm, authoritarian suppression, and targeted harassment.
2. Licensees may adjust algorithmic or threshold parameters so long as the module’s core detection capabilities remain robust and aligned with the latest Risk Definition Canvas.
3. The Licensor reserves the right to audit the source code and documentation of any Derivative Work to verify compliance with this Section 3.

## 4. Audit & Compliance
- Licensees shall maintain documentation demonstrating the inclusion and correct functioning of the Latent Integrity Assessment module.
- Upon reasonable request, Licensees must grant the Licensor or its designees access to source code or documentation to confirm compliance.
