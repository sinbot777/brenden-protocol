# Brenden Protocol: Canvas-Based Memory System for AI

This repository contains a reproducible system for managing long-term memory in AI interactions using self-contained canvases and markdown indexes. Created by Brenden Kelly, this protocol is designed to support:

- Structured project tracking across AI sessions
- Persistent memory without relying on internal AI memory
- Cross-platform compatibility with ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and others

## 🔧 Contents

- `memory_protocol_v1.md` — Full spec for the Brenden Protocol memory system
- `brenden_protocol_starter_kit.md` — Guide and templates for new users
- `LICENSE` — MIT License for reuse and remixing

## 📚 What It Solves

Most AI sessions lose track of projects, context, or prior decisions. The Brenden Protocol uses simple markdown canvases and index files to:

- Make memory actions explicit
- Enable versioning and replacement
- Allow users to delegate structure to the AI

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Start with your Master Index (see Starter Kit).
2. Use natural instructions like “Index this under X” or “This replaces Y.”
3. Your AI will maintain and retrieve memory from canvases, not internal chat.
